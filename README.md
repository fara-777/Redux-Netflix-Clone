## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows for the creation of reusable UI components and facilitates efficient rendering and state management.

- Redux: A predictable state container for JavaScript applications. Redux helps manage the application's state, enabling easier data flow and state management.

- React Router: A library that provides routing capabilities in a React application. It allows for navigation between different pages and enables bookmarking of specific routes.

- API Integration: The project integrates with an API to fetch movie data, including details and trailers. This ensures the availability of up-to-date content.
